# UI Runtime Errors

## Summary
Scan executed with role **ADMIN** using strict `ui-runtime-menu-scan` skill.
No critical runtime errors detected.

## Observations
- **Token Expiry/Redirect:** Occurred once during navigation test. Recovered by re-login. This is expected behavior for session timeout or invalid token state, not a functional crash.

## Critical
- None.
